title: Exponential Lower Bounds for Planning in MDPs With Linearly-Realizable Optimal
  Action-Value Functions
abstract: 'We consider the problem of local planning in fixed-horizon and discounted
  Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with linear function approximation and a generative
  model under the assumption that the optimal action-value function lies in the span
  of a feature map that is available to the planner. Previous work has left open the
  question of whether there exist sound planners that need only $\mbox{poly}(H,d)$
  queries regardless of the MDP, where $H$ is the horizon and $d$ is the dimensionality
  of the features. We answer this question in the negative: we show that any sound
  planner must query at least $\min(e^{\Omega(d)},\Omega(2^H))$ samples in the fized-horizon
  setting and $e^{\Omega(d)}$ samples in the discounted setting. We also show that
  for any $\delta>0$, the least-squares value iteration algorithm with $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^5
  d^{H+1}/\delta^2)$ queries can compute a $\delta$-optimal policy in the fixed-horizon
  setting. We discuss implications and remaining open questions.'
