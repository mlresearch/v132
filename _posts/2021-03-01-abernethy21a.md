title: 'Last-Iterate Convergence Rates for Min-Max Optimization: Convergence of Hamiltonian
  Gradient Descent and Consensus Optimization'
abstract: While classic work in convex-concave min-max optimization relies on average-iterate
  convergence results, the emergence of nonconvex applications such as training Generative
  Adversarial Networks has led to renewed interest in last-iterate convergence guarantees.
  Proving last-iterate convergence is challenging because many natural algorithms,
  such as Simultaneous Gradient Descent/Ascent, provably diverge or cycle even in
  simple convex-concave min-max settings, and there are relatively few papers that
  prove global last-iterate convergence rates beyond the bilinear and convex-strongly
  concave settings. In this work, we show that the Hamiltonian Gradient Descent (HGD)
  algorithm achieves linear convergence in a variety of more general settings, including
  convex-concave problems that satisfy a "sufficiently bilinear" condition. We also
  prove convergence rates for stochastic HGD and for some parameter settings of the
  Consensus Optimization algorithm of Mescheder et al. (2017).
