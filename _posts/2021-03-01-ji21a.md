title: Characterizing the implicit bias via a primal-dual analysis
abstract: " This paper shows that the implicit bias of gradient descent on linearly
  separable data is exactly characterized by the optimal solution of a dual optimization
  problem given by a smoothed margin, even for general losses. This is in contrast
  to prior results, which are often tailored to exponentially-tailed losses. For the
  exponential loss specifically, with $n$ training examples and $t$ gradient descent
  steps, our dual analysis further allows us to prove an $O\\del{\\ln(n)/\\ln(t)}$
  convergence rate to the $\\ell_2$ maximum margin direction, when a constant step
  size is used. This rate is tight in both $n$ and $t$, which has not been presented
  by prior work. On the other hand, with a properly chosen but aggressive step size
  schedule, we prove $O(1/t)$ rates for both $\\ell_2$ margin maximization and implicit
  bias, whereas prior work (including all first-order methods for the general hard-margin
  linear SVM problem) proved $\\widetilde{O}(1/\\sqrt{t})$ margin rates, or $O(1/t)$
  margin rates to a suboptimal margin, with an implied (slower) bias rate. Our key
  observations include that gradient descent on the primal variable naturally induces
  a mirror descent update on the dual variable, and that the dual objective in this
  setting is smooth enough to give a faster rate. "
