title: Stochastic Dueling Bandits with Adversarial Corruption
abstract: 'The dueling bandits problem has received a lot of attention in recent years
  due to its applications in recommendation systems and information retrieval. However,
  due to the prevalence of malicious users in these systems, it is becoming increasingly
  important to design dueling bandit algorithms that are robust to corruptions introduced
  by these malicious users. In this paper we study dueling bandits in the presence
  of an adversary that can corrupt some of the feedback received by the learner. We
  propose an algorithm for this problem that is agnostic to the amount of corruption
  introduced by the adversary: its regret degrades gracefully with the amount of corruption,
  and in case of no corruption, it essentially matches the optimal regret bounds achievable
  in the purely stochastic dueling bandits setting.'
