title: Estimating Sparse Discrete Distributions Under Privacy and Communication Constraints
abstract: We consider the problem of estimating sparse discrete distributions under
  local differential privacy (LDP) and communication constraints. We characterize
  the sample complexity for sparse estimation under LDP constraints up to a constant
  factor, and the sample complexity under communication constraints up to a logarithmic
  factor. Our upper bounds under LDP are based on the Hadamard Response, a private
  coin scheme that requires only one bit of communication per user. Under communication
  constraints we propose public coin schemes based on random hashing functions. Our
  tight lower bounds are based on recently proposed method of chi squared contractions.
