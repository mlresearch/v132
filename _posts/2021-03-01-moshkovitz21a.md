title: Unexpected Effects of Online no-Substitution $k$-means Clustering
abstract: 'Offline $k$-means clustering was studied extensively, and algorithms with
  a constant approximation are available. However, online clustering is still uncharted.
  New factors come into play: the ordering of the dataset and whether the number of
  points, $n$, is known in advance or not. Their exact effects are unknown. In this
  paper we focus on the online setting where the decisions are irreversible: after
  a point arrives, the algorithm needs to decide whether to take the point as a center
  or not, and this decision is final. How many centers are needed and sufficient to
  achieve constant approximation in this setting? We show upper and lower bounds for
  all the different cases. These bounds are exactly the same up to a constant, thus
  achieving optimal bounds. For example, for $k$-means cost with constant $k>1$ and
  random order, $\Theta(\log n)$ centers are enough to achieve a constant approximation,
  while the mere a priori knowledge of $n$ reduces the number of centers to a constant.
  These bounds hold for any distance function that obeys a triangle-type inequality.'
