title: Submodular combinatorial information measures with applications in machine
  learning
abstract: Information-theoretic quantities like entropy and mutual information have
  found numerous uses in machine learning. It is well known that there is a strong
  connection between these entropic quantities and submodularity since entropy over
  a set of random variables is submodular. In this paper, we study combinatorial information
  measures defined over sets of (not necessarily random) variables. These measures
  strictly generalize the corresponding entropic measures since they are all parameterized
  via submodular functions that themselves strictly generalize entropy. Critically,
  we show that, unlike entropic mutual information in general, the submodular mutual
  information is actually submodular in one argument, holding the other fixed, for
  a large class of submodular functions whose third-order partial derivatives satisfy
  a non-negativity property (also called second-order supermodular functions). We
  study specific instantiations of the submodular information measures, and see that
  they all have mathematically intuitive and practically useful expressions. Regarding
  applications, we connect the maximization of submodular (conditional) mutual information
  to problems such as mutual-information-based, query-based, and privacy preserving
  summarization â€” and we connect optimizing the multi-set submodular mutual information
  to clustering and robust partitioning.
