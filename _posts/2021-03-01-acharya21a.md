title: Differentially Private Assouad, Fano, and Le Cam
abstract: 'Le Cam’s method, Fano’s inequality, and Assouad’s lemma are three widely
  used techniques to prove lower bounds for statistical estimation tasks. We propose
  their analogues under central differential privacy. Our results are simple, easy
  to apply and we use them to establish sample complexity bounds in several estimation
  tasks. \\{We} establish the optimal sample complexity of discrete distribution estimation
  under total variation distance and $\ell_2$ distance. We also provide lower bounds
  for several other distribution classes, including product distributions and Gaussian
  mixtures that are tight up to logarithmic factors. The technical component of our
  paper relates coupling between distributions to the sample complexity of estimation
  under differential privacy. '
