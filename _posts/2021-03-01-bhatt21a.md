title: Sequential prediction under log-loss with side information
abstract: The problem of online prediction with sequential side information under
  logarithmic loss is studied, and general upper and lower bounds on the minimax regret
  incurred by the predictor is established. The upper bounds on the minimax regret
  are obtained by constructing and analyzing a probability assignment based on mixture
  probability assignments in universal compression, and the lower bounds are obtained
  by way of a redundancyâ€“capacity theorem. A tight characterization of the regret
  is provided in some special settings.
