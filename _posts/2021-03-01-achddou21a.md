title: Efficient Algorithms for Stochastic Repeated Second-price Auctions
abstract: Developing efficient sequential bidding strategies for repeated auctions
  is an important practical challenge in various marketing tasks. In this setting,
  the bidding agent obtains information, on both the value of the item at sale and
  the behavior of the other bidders, only when she wins the auction. Standard bandit
  theory does not apply to this problem due to the presence of action-dependent censoring.
  In this work, we consider second-price auctions and propose novel, efficient UCB-like
  algorithms for this task. These algorithms are analyzed in the stochastic setting,
  assuming regularity of the distribution of the opponents’ bids. We provide regret
  upper bounds that quantify the improvement over the baseline algorithm proposed
  in the literature. The improvement is particularly significant in cases when the
  value of the auctioned item is low, yielding a spectacular reduction in the order
  of the worst-case regret. We further provide the first parametric lower bound for
  this problem that applies to generic UCB-like strategies. As an alternative, we
  propose more explainable strategies which are reminiscent of the Explore Then Commit
  bandit algorithm. We provide a critical analysis of this class of strategies, showing
  both important advantages and limitations. In particular, we provide a minimax lower
  bound and propose a nearly minimax-optimal instance of this class.
