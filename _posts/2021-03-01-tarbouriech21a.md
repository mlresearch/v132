title: Sample Complexity Bounds for Stochastic Shortest Path with a Generative Model
abstract: 'We consider the objective of computing an $\epsilon$-optimal policy in
  a stochastic shortest path (SSP) setting, provided that we can access a generative
  sampling oracle. We propose two algorithms for this setting and derive PAC bounds
  on their sample complexity: one for the case of positive costs and the other for
  the case of non-negative costs under a restricted optimality criterion. While tight
  sample complexity bounds have been derived for the finite-horizon and discounted
  MDPs, the SSP problem is a strict generalization of these settings and it poses
  additional technical challenges due to the fact that no specific time horizon is
  prescribed and policies may never terminate, i.e., we are possibly facing non-proper
  policies. As a consequence, we can neither directly apply existing techniques minimizing
  sample complexity nor rely on a regret-to-PAC conversion leveraging recent regret
  bounds for SSP. Our analysis instead combines SSP-specific tools and variance reduction
  techniques to obtain the first sample complexity bounds for this setting.'
