title: Intervention Efficient Algorithms for Approximate Learning of Causal Graphs
abstract: We study the problem of learning the causal relationships between a set
  of observed variables in the presence of latents, while minimizing the cost of interventions
  on the observed variables. We assume access to an undirected graph $G$ on the observed
  variables whose edges represent either all direct causal relationships or, less
  restrictively, a superset of causal relationships (identified, e.g., via conditional
  independence tests or a domain expert). Our goal is to recover the directions of
  all causal or ancestral relations in $G$, via a minimum cost set of interventions.
  It is known that constructing an exact minimum cost intervention set for an arbitrary
  graph $G$ is NP-hard. We further argue that, conditioned on the hardness of approximate
  graph coloring, no polynomial time algorithm can achieve an approximation factor
  better than $\Theta(\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of observed variables in $G$.
  To overcome this limitation, we introduce a bi-criteria approximation goal that
  lets us recover the directions of all but $\epsilon n^2$ edges in $G$, for some
  specified error parameter $\epsilon > 0$. Under this relaxed goal, we give polynomial
  time algorithms that achieve intervention cost within a small constant factor of
  the optimal. Our algorithms combine work on efficient intervention design and the
  design of low-cost separating set systems, with ideas from the literature on graph
  property testing.
