title: Optimal Regret Bounds for Generalized Linear Bandits under Parameter Drift
abstract: Generalized Linear Bandits (GLBs) are powerful extensions to the Linear
  Bandit (LB) setting, broadening the benefits of reward parametrization beyond linearity.
  In this paper we study GLBs in non-stationary environments, characterized by a general
  metric of non-stationarity known as the variation-budget or \emph{parameter-drift},
  denoted $B_T$. While previous attempts have been made to extend LB algorithms to
  this setting, they overlook a salient feature of GLBs which flaws their results.
  In this work, we introduce a new algorithm that addresses this difficulty. We prove
  that it enjoys a $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{2/3}B_T^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ regret-bound,
  matching (up to logarithmic factors) the minimax lower-bound established for LB.
  At the core of our contribution is a generalization of the projection step introduced
  in Filippi et al (2010), adapted to the non-stationary nature of the problem. Our
  analysis sheds light on central mechanisms inherited from the setting by explicitly
  splitting the treatment of the learning and tracking aspects of the problem.
