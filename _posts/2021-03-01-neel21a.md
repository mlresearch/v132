title: 'Descent-to-Delete: Gradient-Based Methods for Machine Unlearning'
abstract: 'We study the data deletion problem for convex models. By leveraging techniques
  from convex optimization and reservoir sampling, we give the first data deletion
  algorithms that are able to handle an arbitrarily long sequence of adversarial updates
  while promising both per-deletion run-time and steady-state error that do not grow
  with the length of the update sequence. We also introduce several new conceptual
  distinctions: for example, we can ask that after a deletion, the entire state maintained
  by the optimization algorithm is statistically indistinguishable from the state
  that would have resulted had we retrained, or we can ask for the weaker condition
  that only the observable output is statistically indistinguishable from the observable
  output that would have resulted from retraining. We are able to give more efficient
  deletion algorithms under this weaker deletion criterion.'
