title: On the Sample Complexity of Privately Learning Unbounded High-Dimensional Gaussians
abstract: We provide sample complexity upper bounds for agnostically learning multivariate
  Gaussians under the constraint of approximate differential privacy. These are the
  first finite sample upper bounds for general Gaussians which do not impose restrictions
  on the parameters of the distribution. Our bounds are near-optimal in the case when
  the covariance is known to be the identity, and conjectured to be near-optimal in
  the general case. From a technical standpoint, we provide analytic tools for arguing
  the existence of global “locally small” covers from local covers of the space. These
  are exploited using modifications of recent techniques for differentially private
  hypothesis selection. Our techniques may prove useful for privately learning other
  distribution classes which do not possess a finite cover.
