title: Statistical guarantees for generative models without domination
abstract: In this paper, we introduce a convenient framework for studying (adversarial)
  generative models from a statistical perspective. It consists in modeling the generative
  device as a smooth transformation of the unit hypercube of a dimension that is much
  smaller than that of the ambient space and measuring the quality of the generative
  model by means of an integral probability metric. In the particular case of integral
  probability metric defined through a smoothness class, we establish a risk bound
  quantifying the role of various parameters. In particular, it clearly shows the
  impact of dimension reduction on the error of the generative model.
