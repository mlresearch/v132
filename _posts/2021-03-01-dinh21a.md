title: Last Round Convergence and No-Dynamic Regret in Asymmetric Repeated Games
abstract: This paper considers repeated games in which one player has a different
  objective than others. In particular, we investigate repeated two-player zero-sum
  games where the column player not only aims to minimize her regret but also stabilize
  the actions. Suppose that while repeatedly playing this game, the row player chooses
  her strategy at each round by using a no-regret algorithm to minimize her regret.
  We develop a no-dynamic regret algorithm for the column player to exhibit last round
  convergence to a minimax equilibrium. We show that our algorithm is efficient against
  a large set of popular no-regret algorithms the row player can use, including the
  multiplicative weights update algorithm, general follow-the-regularized-leader and
  any no-regret algorithms satisfy a property so called “stability”.
