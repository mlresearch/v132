title: 'Attribute-Efficient Learning of Halfspaces with Malicious Noise: Near-Optimal
  Label Complexity and Noise Tolerance'
abstract: This paper is concerned with computationally efficient learning of homogeneous
  sparse halfspaces in $\mathbb{R}^d$ under noise. Though recent works have established
  attribute-efficient learning algorithms under various types of label noise (e.g.
  bounded noise), it remains an open question of when and how $s$-sparse halfspaces
  can be efficiently learned under the challenging {\em malicious noise} model, where
  an adversary may corrupt both the unlabeled examples and the labels. We answer this
  question in the affirmative by designing a computationally efficient active learning
  algorithm with near-optimal label complexity of $\tilde{O}(s \log^4\frac{d}{\epsilon})$
  and noise tolerance $\eta = \Omega(\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon \in (0, 1)$ is the
  target error rate, under the assumption that the distribution over (uncorrupted)
  unlabeled examples is isotropic log-concave. Our algorithm can be straightforwardly
  tailored to the passive learning setting, and we show that the sample complexity
  is $\tilde{O}(\frac{1}{\epsilon}s^2 \log^5 d)$ which also enjoys attribute efficiency.
  Our main techniques include attribute-efficient paradigms for soft outlier removal
  and for empirical risk minimization, and a new analysis of uniform concentration
  for unbounded instances – all of them crucially take the sparsity structure of the
  underlying halfspace into account.
