title: 'Adversarial Online Learning with Changing Action Sets: Efficient Algorithms
  with Approximate Regret Bounds'
abstract: 'We revisit the problem of online learning with sleeping experts/bandits:
  in each time step, only a subset of the actions are available for the algorithm
  to choose from (and learn about). The work of Kleinberg et al. (2010) showed that
  there exist no-regret algorithms which perform no worse than the best ranking of
  actions asymptotically. Unfortunately, achieving this regret bound appears computationally
  hard: Kanade and Steinke (2014) showed that achieving this no-regret performance
  is at least as hard as PAC-learning DNFs, a notoriously difficult problem. In the
  present work, we relax the original problem and study computationally efficient
  no-approximate-regret algorithms: such algorithms may exceed the optimal cost by
  a multiplicative constant in addition to the additive regret. We give an algorithm
  that provides a no-approximate-regret guarantee for the general sleeping expert/bandit
  problems. For several canonical special cases of the problem, we give algorithms
  with significantly better approximation ratios; these algorithms also illustrate
  different techniques for achieving no-approximate-regret guarantees. '
