title: 'Testing Product Distributions: A Closer Look'
abstract: 'We study the problems of {\em identity} and {\em closeness testing} of
  $n$-dimensional product distributions. Prior works of Canonne, Diakonikolas, Kane
  and Stewart (COLT 2017) and Daskalakis and Pan (COLT 2017) have established tight
  sample complexity bounds for {\em non-tolerant testing over a binary alphabet}:
  given two product distributions $P$ and $Q$ over a binary alphabet, distinguish
  between the cases $P=Q$ and $d_{\mathrm{TV}}(P,Q)>\epsilon$. We build on this prior
  work to give a more comprehensive map of the complexity of testing of product distributions
  by investigating {\em tolerant testing with respect to several natural distance
  measures and over an arbitrary alphabet}. Our study gives a fine-grained understanding
  of how the sample complexity of tolerant testing varies with the distance measures
  for product distributions. In addition, we also extend one of our upper bounds on
  product distributions to bounded-degree Bayes nets.'
