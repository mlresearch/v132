title: Precise Minimax Regret for Logistic Regression with Categorical Feature Values
abstract: We study logistic regression with binary labels and categorical (discrete)
  feature values. Our goal is to evaluate precisely the (maximal) minimax regret.
  We express it as the so called Shtarkov sum known in information theory. To the
  best of our knowledge such a sum was never computed in the context of logistic regression.
  To be more precise, the pointwise regret of an online algorithm is defined as the
  (excess) loss it incurs over some value of a constant comparator (weight vector)
  that is used for prediction. It depends on the feature values, label sequence, and
  the learning algorithm. In the maximal minimax scenario we seek the best weights
  for the worst label sequence over all possible learning algorithms/ distributions,
  therefore it constitutes a lower bound for the pointwise regret. For finite dimension
  $d$ and $N$ distinct feature vectors we show that the maximal minimax regret grows
  as $$ \frac{d}{2} \log (T/2\pi)+C_d + O(N/\sqrt{T}) $$ where $T$ is the number of
  rounds of running a training algorithm and $C_d$ is explicitly computable constant
  that depends on the feature values and dimension $d$. We also extend these results
  to non-binary labels. The {\it precise} maximal minimax regret presented here is
  the first result of this kind. Our findings are obtained using tools of analytic
  combinatorics and information theory.
