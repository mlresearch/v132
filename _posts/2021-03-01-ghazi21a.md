title: Near-tight closure b ounds for the Littlestone and threshold dimensions
abstract: We study closure properties for the Littlestone and threshold dimensions
  of binary hypothesis classes. Given classes $\mathcal{H}_1, \ldots, \mathcal{H}_k$
  of binary functions with bounded Littlestone (respectively, threshold) dimension,
  we establish an upper bound on the Littlestone (respectively, threshold) dimension
  of the class defined by applying an arbitrary binary aggregation rule to $\mathcal{H}_1,
  \ldots, \mathcal{H}_k$. We also show that our upper bounds are nearly tight. Our
  upper bounds give an exponential (in $k$) improvement upon analogous bounds shown
  by Alon et al. (COLT 2020), thus answering an open question posed by their work.
