title: 'Bounding, Concentrating, and Truncating: Unifying Privacy Loss Composition
  for Data Analytics'
abstract: We unify existing privacy loss composition bounds for special classes of
  differentially private (DP) algorithms along with general DP composition bounds.
  In particular, we provide strong privacy loss bounds when an analyst may select
  pure DP, bounded range (e.g. exponential mechanisms), or concentrated DP mechanisms
  in any adaptively selected order. We also provide optimal privacy loss bounds that
  apply when an analyst can select pure DP and bounded range mechanisms in a batch,
  i.e. non-adaptively. Further, when an analyst selects mechanisms within each class
  adaptively, we show a difference in privacy loss between different, predetermined
  orderings of pure DP and bounded range mechanisms. Lastly, we compare the composition
  bounds of Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms and provide new private mechanisms for
  top-$k$ using truncated Gaussian noise.
