title: Online Learning of Facility Locations
abstract: In this paper, we provide a rigorous theoretical investigation of an online
  learning version of the Facility Location problem which is motivated by emerging
  problems in real-world applications. In our formulation, we are given a set of sites
  and an online sequence of user requests. At each trial, the learner selects a subset
  of sites and then incurs a cost for each selected site and an additional cost which
  is the price of the userâ€™s connection to the nearest site in the selected subset.
  The problem may be solved by an application of the well-known Hedge algorithm. This
  would, however, require time and space exponential in the number of the given sites,
  which motivates our design of a novel quasi-linear time algorithm for this problem,
  with good theoretical guarantees on its performance.
