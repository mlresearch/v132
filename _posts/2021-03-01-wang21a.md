title: Estimating Smooth GLM in Non-interactive Local Differential Privacy Model with
  Public Unlabeled Data
abstract: 'In this paper, we study the problem of estimating smooth Generalized Linear
  Models (GLM) in the Non-interactive Local Differential Privacy (NLDP) model. Different
  from its classical setting, our model allows the server to access some additional
  public but unlabeled data. By using Steinâ€™s lemma and its variants, we first show
  that there is an $(\epsilon, \delta)$-NLDP algorithm for GLM (under some mild assumptions),
  if each data record is i.i.d sampled from some sub-Gaussian distribution with bounded
  $\ell_1$-norm. Then with high probability, the sample complexity of the public and
  private data, for the algorithm to achieve an $\alpha$ estimation error (in $\ell_\infty$-norm),
  is $O(p^2\alpha^{-2})$ and ${O}(p^2\alpha^{-2}\epsilon^{-2})$, respectively, if
  $\alpha$ is not too small ({\em i.e.,} $\alpha\geq \Omega(\frac{1}{\sqrt{p}})$),
  where $p$ is the dimensionality of the data. This is a significant improvement over
  the previously known exponential or quasi-polynomial in $\alpha^{-1}$, or exponential
  in $p$ sample complexity of GLM with no public data. We then extend our idea to
  the non-linear regression problem and show a similar phenomenon for it. Finally,
  we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms through experiments on both synthetic
  and real world datasets. To our best knowledge, this is the first paper showing
  the existence of efficient and effective algorithms for GLM and non-linear regression
  in the NLDP model with public unlabeled data. '
