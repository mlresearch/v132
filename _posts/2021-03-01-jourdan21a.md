title: Efficient Pure Exploration for Combinatorial Bandits with Semi-Bandit Feedback
abstract: Combinatorial bandits with semi-bandit feedback generalize multi-armed bandits,
  where the agent chooses sets of arms and observes a noisy reward for each arm contained
  in the chosen set. The action set satisfies a given structure such as forming a
  base of a matroid or a path in a graph. We focus on the pure-exploration problem
  of identifying the best arm with fixed confidence, as well as a more general setting,
  where the structure of the answer set differs from the one of the action set. Using
  the recently popularized game framework, we interpret this problem as a sequential
  zero-sum game and develop a CombGame meta-algorithm whose instances are asymptotically
  optimal algorithms with finite time guarantees. In addition to comparing two families
  of learners to instantiate our meta-algorithm, the main contribution of our work
  is a specific oracle efficient instance for best-arm identification with combinatorial
  actions. Based on a projection-free online learning algorithm for convex polytopes,
  it is the first computationally efficient algorithm which is asymptotically optimal
  and has competitive empirical performance.
