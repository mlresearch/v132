title: Stochastic Top-$K$ Subset Bandits with Linear Space and Non-Linear Feedback
abstract: Many real-world problems like Social Influence Maximization face the dilemma
  of choosing the best $K$ out of $N$ options at a given time instant. This setup
  can be modeled as a combinatorial bandit which chooses $K$ out of $N$ arms at each
  time, with an aim to achieve an efficient trade-off between exploration and exploitation.
  This is the first work for combinatorial bandits where the feedback received can
  be a non-linear function of the chosen $K$ arms. The direct use of multi-armed bandit
  requires choosing among $N$-choose-$K$ options making the state space large. In
  this paper, we present a novel algorithm which is computationally efficient and
  the storage is linear in $N$. The proposed algorithm is a divide-and-conquer based
  strategy, that we call CMAB-SM. Further, the proposed algorithm achieves a \textit{regret
  bound} of $\tilde O(K^{\frac{1}{2}}N^{\frac{1}{3}}T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ for a time horizon
  $T$, which is \textit{sub-linear} in all parameters $T$, $N$, and $K$.
