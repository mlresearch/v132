title: An Efficient Algorithm for Cooperative Semi-Bandits
abstract: We consider the problem of asynchronous online combinatorial optimization
  on a network of communicating agents. At each time step, some of the agents are
  stochastically activated, requested to make a prediction, and the system pays the
  corresponding loss. Then, neighbors of active agents receive semi-bandit feedback
  and exchange some succinct local information. The goal is to minimize the network
  regret, defined as the difference between the cumulative loss of the predictions
  of active agents and that of the best action in hindsight, selected from a combinatorial
  decision set. The main challenge in such a context is to control the computational
  complexity of the resulting algorithm while retaining minimax optimal regret guarantees.
  We introduce Coop-FTPL, a cooperative version of the well-known Follow The Perturbed
  Leader algorithm, that implements a new loss estimation procedure generalizing the
  Geometric Resampling of Neu and Bart√≥k [2013] to our setting. Assuming that the
  elements of the decision set are $k$-dimensional binary vectors with at most $m$
  non-zero entries and $\alpha_1$ is the independence number of the network, we show
  that the expected regret of our algorithm after $T$ time steps is of order $Q\sqrt{mkT\log(k)
  (k\alpha_1/Q+m)}$, where $Q$ is the total activation probability mass. Furthermore,
  we prove that this is only $\sqrt{k\log k}$-away from the best achievable rate and
  that Coop-FTPL has a state-of-the-art $T^{3/2}$ worst-case computational complexity.
