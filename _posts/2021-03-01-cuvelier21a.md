title: Asymptotically Optimal Strategies For Combinatorial Semi-Bandits in Polynomial
  Time
abstract: 'We consider combinatorial semi-bandits with uncorrelated Gaussian rewards.
  In this article, we propose the first method, to the best of our knowledge, that
  enables to compute the solution of the Graves-Lai optimization problem in polynomial
  time for many combinatorial structures of interest. In turn, this immediately yields
  the first known approach to implement asymptotically optimal algorithms in polynomial
  time for combinatorial semi-bandits. '
