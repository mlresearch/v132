title: Efficient Learning with Arbitrary Covariate Shift
abstract: 'We give an efficient algorithm for learning a binary function in a given
  class $C$ of bounded VC dimension, with training data distributed according to $P$
  and test data according to $Q$, where $P$ and $Q$ may be arbitrary distributions
  over $X$. This is the generic form of what is called \textit{covariate shift}, which
  is impossible in general as arbitrary $P$ and $Q$ may not even overlap. However,
  recently guarantees were given in a model called PQ-learning (Goldwasser et al.,
  2020) where the learner has: (a) access to unlabeled test examples from $Q$ (in
  addition to labeled samples from $P$, i.e., semi-supervised learning); and (b) the
  option to \textit{reject} any example and abstain from classifying it (i.e., selective
  classification). The algorithm of Goldwasser et al. (2020) requires an (agnostic)
  noise-tolerant learner for $C$. The present work gives a polynomial-time PQ-learning
  algorithm, called \textit{Slice-and-Dice}, that uses an oracle to a “reliable” learner
  for $C$, where reliable learning (Kalai et al., 2012) is a model of learning with
  one-sided noise. Furthermore, this reduction is optimal in the sense that we show
  the equivalence of reliable and PQ learning.'
