                  such as training Generative Adversarial Networks has
                  led to renewed interest in last-iterate convergence
                  guarantees. Proving last-iterate convergence is
                  challenging because many natural algorithms, such as
                  Simultaneous Gradient Descent/Ascent, provably
                  diverge or cycle even in simple convex-concave
                  min-max settings, and there are relatively few
                  papers that prove global last-iterate convergence
                  rates beyond the bilinear and convex-strongly
                  concave settings. In this work, we show that the
                  Hamiltonian Gradient Descent (HGD) algorithm
                  achieves linear convergence in a variety of more
                  general settings, including convex-concave problems
                  that satisfy a "sufficiently bilinear" condition. We
                  also prove convergence rates for stochastic HGD and
                  for some parameter settings of the Consensus
                  Optimization algorithm of Mescheder et al. (2017).}

  pages =	 {99 -- 150},
  abstract =	 {Developing efficient sequential bidding strategies
                  for repeated auctions is an important practical
                  challenge in various marketing tasks. In this
                  setting, the bidding agent obtains information, on
                  both the value of the item at sale and the behavior
                  of the other bidders, only when she wins the
                  auction. Standard bandit theory does not apply to
                  this problem due to the presence of action-dependent
                  censoring. In this work, we consider second-price
                  auctions and propose novel, efficient UCB-like
                  algorithms for this task. These algorithms are
                  analyzed in the stochastic setting, assuming
                  regularity of the distribution of the opponents'
                  bids. We provide regret upper bounds that quantify
                  the improvement over the baseline algorithm proposed
                  in the literature. The improvement is particularly
                  significant in cases when the value of the auctioned
                  item is low, yielding a spectacular reduction in the
                  order of the worst-case regret. We further provide
                  the first parametric lower bound for this problem
                  that applies to generic UCB-like strategies. As an
                  alternative, we propose more explainable strategies
                  which are reminiscent of the Explore Then Commit
                  bandit algorithm. We provide a critical analysis of
                  this class of strategies, showing both important
                  advantages and limitations. In particular, we
                  provide a minimax lower bound and propose a nearly
                  minimax-optimal instance of this class.}

                  relationships between a set of observed variables in
                  the presence of latents, while minimizing the cost
                  of interventions on the observed variables. We
                  assume access to an undirected graph $G$ on the
                  observed variables whose edges represent either all
                  direct causal relationships or, less restrictively,
                  a superset of causal relationships (identified,
                  e.g., via conditional independence tests or a domain
                  expert). Our goal is to recover the directions of
                  all causal or ancestral relations in $G$, via a
                  minimum cost set of interventions. It is known that
                  constructing an exact minimum cost intervention set
                  for an arbitrary graph $G$ is NP-hard. We further
                  argue that, conditioned on the hardness of
                  approximate graph coloring, no polynomial time
                  algorithm can achieve an approximation factor better
                  than $\Theta(\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of
                  observed variables in $G$. To overcome this
                  limitation, we introduce a bi-criteria approximation
                  goal that lets us recover the directions of all but
                  $\epsilon n^2$ edges in $G$, for some specified
                  error parameter $\epsilon > 0$. Under this relaxed
                  goal, we give polynomial time algorithms that
                  achieve intervention cost within a small constant
                  factor of the optimal. Our algorithms combine work
                  on efficient intervention design and the design of
                  low-cost separating set systems, with ideas from the
                  literature on graph property testing.}

  abstract =	 {The dueling bandits problem has received a lot of
                  attention in recent years due to its applications in
                  recommendation systems and information
                  retrieval. However, due to the prevalence of
                  malicious users in these systems, it is becoming
                  increasingly important to design dueling bandit
                  algorithms that are robust to corruptions introduced
                  by these malicious users. In this paper we study
                  dueling bandits in the presence of an adversary that
                  can corrupt some of the feedback received by the
                  learner. We propose an algorithm for this problem
                  that is agnostic to the amount of corruption
                  introduced by the adversary: its regret degrades
                  gracefully with the amount of corruption, and in
                  case of no corruption, it essentially matches the
                  optimal regret bounds achievable in the purely
                  stochastic dueling bandits setting.}

                  trainability of neural networks by improving the
                  conditioning of certain kernel matrices of the input

                  activation functions under a certain

  abstract =	 { We investigate $k$-means clustering in the online
                  no-substitution setting when the input arrives in
                  \emph{arbitrary} order. In this setting, points
                  arrive one after another, and the algorithm is
                  required to instantly decide whether to take the
                  current point as a center before observing the next
                  point. Decisions are irrevocable. The goal is to
                  minimize both the number of centers and the
                  $k$-means cost. Previous works in this setting
                  assume that the input's order is random, or that the
                  input's aspect ratio is bounded. It is known that if
                  the order is arbitrary and there is no assumption on
                  the input, then any algorithm must take all points
                  as centers. Moreover, assuming a bounded aspect
                  ratio is too restrictive --- it does not include
                  natural input generated from mixture models. We
                  introduce a new complexity measure that quantifies
                  the difficulty of clustering a dataset arriving in
                  arbitrary order. We design a new random algorithm
                  and prove that if applied on data with complexity
                  $d$, the algorithm takes $O(d\log(n) k\log(k))$
                  centers and is an $O(k^3)$-approximation. We also
                  prove that if the data is sampled from a ``natural"
                  distribution, such as a mixture of $k$ Gaussians,
                  then the new complexity measure is equal to
                  $O(k^2\log(n))$. This implies that for data
                  generated from those distributions, our new
                  algorithm takes only $poly(k\log(n))$ centers and is
                  a $poly(k)$-approximation. In terms of negative
                  results, we prove that the number of centers needed
                  to achieve an $\alpha$-approximation is at least
                  $\Omega\left(\frac{d}{k\log(n\alpha)}\right)$.}

  abstract =	 {We give a unified way of testing and learning finite
                  Markov chains from a single Markovian trajectory,
                  using the idea of $k$-cover time introduced
                  here. The $k$-cover time is the expected length of a
                  random walk to cover every state at least $k$
                  times. This generalizes the notion of cover time in
                  the literature. The error metric in the testing and
                  learning problems is the infinity matrix norm
                  between the transition matrices, as considered by
                  Wolfer and Kontorovich. Specifically, we show that
                  if we can learn or test discrete distributions using
                  $k$ samples, then we can learn or test Markov chains
                  using a number of samples equal to the $k$-cover
                  time of the chain, up to constant factors. We then
                  derive asymptotic bounds on the $k$-cover time in
                  terms of the number of states, minimum stationary
                  probability and the cover time of the chain. Our
                  bounds are tight for reversible Markov chains and
                  almost tight (up to logarithmic factors) for
                  irreducible ones. Our results on $k$-cover time
                  yield sample complexity bounds for a wider range of

                  uniformity testing, identity testing, closeness
                  testing and their tolerant versions) over Markov
                  chains, and can be applied to a broader family of
                  Markov chains (irreducible and reversible ones) than
                  previous results which only applies to ergodic

  abstract =	 { We study the problem of learning a mixture of two
                  subspaces over $\mathbb{F}_2^n$. The goal is to
                  recover the individual subspaces, given samples from
                  a (weighted) mixture of samples drawn uniformly from
                  the two subspaces A_0 and A_1. This problem is
                  computationally challenging, as it captures the
                  notorious problem of ``learning parities with noise"
                  in the degenerate setting when $A_1 \subseteq
                  A_0$. This is in contrast to the analogous problem
                  over the reals that can be solved in polynomial time
                  (Vidal'03). This leads to the following natural
                  question: is Learning Parities with Noise the only
                  computational barrier in obtaining efficient
                  algorithms for learning mixtures of subspaces over
                  $\mathbb{F}_2^n$? The main result of this paper is
                  an affirmative answer to the above question. Namely,
                  we show the following results: 1. When the subspaces
                  $A_0$ and $A_1$ are incomparable, i.e., $A_0$ and
                  $A_1$ are not contained inside each other, then
                  there is a polynomial time algorithm to recover the
                  subspaces $A_0$ and $A_1$. 2. In the case when $A_1$
                  is a subspace of $A_0$ with a significant gap in the
                  dimension i.e., $dim(A_1) \le \alpha dim(A_0)$ for
                  $\alpha<1$, there is a $n^{O(1/(1-\alpha))}$ time
                  algorithm to recover the subspaces $A_0$ and
                  $A_1$. Thus, our algorithms imply computational
                  tractability of the problem of learning mixtures of
                  two subspaces, except in the degenerate setting
                  captured by learning parities with noise. }

                  dimensions for a class of nonlinearities that
                  includes the popular Sigmoid SoftPlus, and Gaussian
                  functions. We strengthen this result to give
                  relative error embeddings under some further
                  restrictions, which are satisfied e.g., by the Tanh,
                  SoftSign, Exponential Linear Unit, and many other
                  `soft' step functions and rectifying
                  units. Understanding embeddings for subspaces under
                  nonlinear transformations is a key step towards
                  extending random sketching and compressing sensing
                  techniques for linear problems to nonlinear ones. We
                  discuss example applications of our results to
                  improved bounds for compressed sensing via
                  generative neural networks.}

                  machine learning. It is well known that there is a
                  strong connection between these entropic quantities
                  and submodularity since entropy over a set of random
                  variables is submodular. In this paper, we study
                  combinatorial information measures defined over sets
                  of (not necessarily random) variables. These
                  measures strictly generalize the corresponding
                  entropic measures since they are all parameterized
                  via submodular functions that themselves strictly
                  generalize entropy. Critically, we show that, unlike
                  entropic mutual information in general, the
                  submodular mutual information is actually submodular
                  in one argument, holding the other fixed, for a
                  large class of submodular functions whose
                  third-order partial derivatives satisfy a
                  non-negativity property (also called second-order
                  supermodular functions). We study specific

                  measures, and see that they all have mathematically
                  intuitive and practically useful
                  expressions. Regarding applications, we connect the
                  maximization of submodular (conditional) mutual
                  information to problems such as
                  mutual-information-based, query-based, and privacy

  abstract =	 {We study logistic regression with binary labels and
                  categorical (discrete) feature values. Our goal is
                  to evaluate precisely the (maximal) minimax
                  regret. We express it as the so called Shtarkov sum
                  known in information theory. To the best of our
                  knowledge such a sum was never computed in the
                  context of logistic regression. To be more precise,
                  the pointwise regret of an online algorithm is
                  defined as the (excess) loss it incurs over some
                  value of a constant comparator (weight vector) that
                  is used for prediction. It depends on the feature
                  values, label sequence, and the learning
                  algorithm. In the maximal minimax scenario we seek
                  the best weights for the worst label sequence over
                  all possible learning algorithms/ distributions,
                  therefore it constitutes a lower bound for the
                  pointwise regret. For finite dimension $d$ and $N$
                  distinct feature vectors we show that the maximal
                  minimax regret grows as $$ \frac{d}{2} \log
                  (T/2\pi)+C_d + O(N/\sqrt{T}) $$ where $T$ is the
                  number of rounds of running a training algorithm and
                  $C_d$ is explicitly computable constant that depends
                  on the feature values and dimension $d$. We also
                  extend these results to non-binary labels. The {\it
                  precise} maximal minimax regret presented here is
                  the first result of this kind. Our findings are
                  obtained using tools of analytic combinatorics and
                  information theory.}

                  exponentially-tailed losses. For the exponential
                  loss specifically, with $n$ training examples and
                  $t$ gradient descent steps, our dual analysis
                  further allows us to prove an $O\del{\ln(n)/\ln(t)}$

                  $O(1/t)$ margin rates to a suboptimal margin, with
                  an implied (slower) bias rate. Our key observations
                  include that gradient descent on the primal variable
                  naturally induces a mirror descent update on the
                  dual variable, and that the dual objective in this
                  setting is smooth enough to give a faster rate. }

                  processes (GPs) under misspecified priors, with an
                  eye towards Bayesian Optimization (BO). GPs are
                  widely used in BO because they easily enable
                  exploration based on posterior uncertainty
                  bands. However, this convenience comes at the cost
                  of robustness: a typical function encountered in
                  practice is unlikely to have been drawn from the
                  data scientist's prior, in which case uncertainty
                  estimates can be misleading, and the resulting
                  exploration can be suboptimal. We present a
                  frequentist approach to GP/BO uncertainty
                  quantification. We utilize the GP framework as a
                  working model, but do not assume correctness of the
                  prior. We instead construct a \emph{confidence
                  sequence} (CS) for the unknown function using
                  martingale techniques. There is a necessary cost to
                  achieving robustness: if the prior was correct,
                  posterior GP bands are narrower than our
                  CS. Nevertheless, when the prior is wrong, our CS is
                  statistically valid and empirically outperforms
                  standard GP methods, in terms of both coverage and
                  utility for BO. Additionally, we demonstrate that
                  powered likelihoods provide robustness against model
                  misspecification.}

                  (e.g. bounded noise), it remains an open question of

                  labels. We answer this question in the affirmative
                  by designing a computationally efficient active

                  non-binary. Characterization of non-binary online
                  learnable classes is more involved for general loss
                  functions and is not captured fully by the
                  countability condition even for the ternary label
                  case. In the computational bounded setup, we compare
                  our results with well known results in recursive
                  function learning, showing that the class of all
                  total computable functions is indeed learnable with
                  computable online learners and randomized
                  sampling. Finally, we also show that the finite
                  error guarantee will not be affected even when
                  independent noise is added to the label.}
